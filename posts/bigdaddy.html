    <p>This circuit was created by RunOffGroove. It's not too bad to build, low part count and sounds pretty good<br><br>

    They used a J201 Jfet in the original, I used an MMBFJ201 smd type mounted to a pcb that made it workable. I had to watch the pinout.<br>
    I soldered the chip carefully to the board myself, but you can buy them pre mounted to the boards which would be way easier.</p>
