    <h1>Ibanez TS9</h1>
    <div class="meta">January 12, 2026 · Overdrive</div>

    <p>This classic overdrive has been used and recreated by many over the years.<br>
    Nothing wrong with the circuit but the one I built, close to 2 years ago, had some issues that I'm sure were my doing. It was one of the early ones I tried and it worked but had low output and sounded a bit tinny.<br>
    Possibly could have been my setup at the time didn't help...ended up tearing it apart for the parts.<br><br>
