    <p>The Headbanger Headphone Amp <br><br>I've messed with this circuit 
quite a bit, it's very capable despite it's small size. The original 
site where I got my information for it is <a href="https://www.minidisc.org/headbanger.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a><br>
The schematic I worked from:<br>
    <img src="/pics/headbanger_schem.gif" alt="Headbanger schematic"><br>
    I just made it so it would work with a +9 volt supply.</p><br>
    <p>A vero layout I created for the same, the power and ground wires could be
 relocated below the output lines to keep them away from signal but I don't think it's necessary.<br><br>
As stated below R2 and R4 should be at least a 1/2 watt resistor with an air gap between them and the board for longevity.<br>

   <p>Here is a schematic I did for a guitar to headphone amp.<br>

    Also here is a vero layout for half of the Headbanger which works well for a preamp, boost or just a mini practice amp.<br><br>
    Update 1/12/26:<br>
    Was messing with this today getting some measurements and discovered that the 10 ohm resistor R2 gets quite warm if running at high volumes for short times.<br>
    I used 1/4 watt so I would recommend that resistor to be at least a 1/2 watt and probably good idea to have an air gap between that and the board.</p><br>

    <p>You could add a tone control if you wanted to, I haven't done that with this circuit. Usually whatever I'm running through it has it's own tone control.
