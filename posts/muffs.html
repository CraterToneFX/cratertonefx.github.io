    <h1>Muffs</h1>

    <p>The first big muff that I tried was the EHX NYC Big Muff. Maybe I should have tried something a little less...<br><br>

    It did work, sounded like it should just the output was low so I probably had something wrong or a poor solder joint etc.<br><br></p>
    <hr style="border: 2px solid grey; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;"><br><br>
    <p>The next one was the EHX Big Muff 1977 OpAmp version.<br><br>

    This one works great and is a great sounding muff.<br>
    Not sure who created this layout, you can find it hear and there. Looks like one from <a href="https://www.sabrotone.com/">Harold Sabro</a>.<br>
    His usually have his name at the top...so not sure.<br><br></p>
    <hr style="border: 2px solid grey; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;"><br><br>
    <p>The next one was the EHX Big Muff 1978 Quad  OpAmp version.<br><br>

    This one works great also. It uses a quad op amp instead of 2 dual op amps, I thought this had a little coarser sound to it. Still sounds great tho.<br><br></p>
    <hr style="border: 2px solid grey; width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;"><br><br>
    <p>The next one is the Big Muff PI Ram's Head. I liked this one enough that it's the current one on my pedal board.<br><br>

    As you can see there are a lot of variations of Big Muff circuits. The Ram's Head is the only one I've tried so far out of this bunch.<br>
    This one is from <a href="https://www.sabrotone.com/">Harold Sabro</a> as you can see.<br><br></p>
