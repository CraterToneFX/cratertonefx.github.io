    <p>This is a nice little splitter. I built this with something else in mind.<br><br>

    I wanted to turn this into an ABY box to run a guitar into 2 amps at once, see what kind of tone can come of it. So I found this drawing of how to hook it up that way<br><br>

    The only thing I did different was add level b100k potentiometers to each output from the splitter board in case I needed them and had a 4.7k resistor to each of the led's.<br>
    The potentiometers would be wired: out A - out B to pin 3 on pots, pin 2 on pots out to respective pins on switches as per the drawing. Pin 1 on pots to ground.<br>
    Once finished it worked well in testing. I haven't had it hooked to 2 amps yet, my son is going to test that part. I will update with results when available.<br><br></p>
