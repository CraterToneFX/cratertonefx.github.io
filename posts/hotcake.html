    <p>There are 2 versions of this circuit on Guitar FX Layouts. <br>
      A buffered version and a non buffered version, the reason was because some people had issues with the circuit oscillating with presence and gain maxed.<br>
    Certain types of pickups could be a contributing factor. I chose to try the non buffered version and I didn't have any trouble with it. Not sure what type pickups were the issue but guessing active ones.<br><br>

      Otherwise good sounding overdrive.<br><br></p>
